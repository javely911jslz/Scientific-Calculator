Scientific Calculator

* Overview
The Scientific Calculator is a user-friendly web-based application designed to perform both basic and advanced mathematical operations. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this calculator offers an interactive interface that mimics real-life scientific calculators while ensuring smooth and accurate computation.
Features
1. Basic arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. Advanced functions: Square, square root, power, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential operations
3. Error handling for invalid inputs
4. Responsive design — works seamlessly on desktop and mobile browsers
5. Keyboard input support for quick calculations

* Technologies Used
 
HTML5 – for structure and layout
CSS3 – for styling and responsive design
JavaScript (ES6) – for logic and interactivity

* How to Use:
Open the calculator in any modern browser.
Enter numbers using the on-screen buttons or your keyboard.
Choose an operation (e.g., +, −, ×, ÷, sin, cos, log, etc.).
Press = to get the result instantly.
Use C or AC to clear the display and start a new calculation.

* Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript
Mathematical function implementation
UI/UX design principles for web tools
